          <h1>Your Brain on the Movies</h1>
            <br><h3>A Computational Approach for Predicting Box-office Performance
              from Viewer's Brain Responses to Movie Trailers. Dec, 2017
            </h3>
            <br>
            <p>The ability to anticipate the population-wide response of a target audience to a
               new movie or TV series, before its release, is critical to the film industry. Equally
              important is the ability to understand the underlying factors that drive or characterize
              viewer's decision to watch a movie. Traditional approaches (which involve pilot test-screenings,
              questionnaires, and focus groups) have reached a plateau in their ability to predict the
              population-wide responses to new movies. In this study, we develop a novel computational approach
              for extracting neurophysiological electroencephalography (EEG) and eye-gaze based metrics to predict
              the population-wide behavior of movie goers.
              <br>
              <br>
              We further, explore the connection of the derived metrics
              to the underlying cognitive processes that might drive moviegoers' decision to watch a movie. Towards
              that, we recorded neural activity-through the use of EEG-and eye-gaze activity from a group of naive
              individuals while watching movie trailers of pre-selected movies for which the population-wide preference is
              captured by the movie's market performance (i.e., box-office ticket sales in the US). Our findings show that
              the neural based metrics, derived using the proposed methodology, carry predictive information about
              the broader audience decisions to watch a movie, above and beyond traditional methods. In particular,
              neural metrics are shown to predict up to 72% of the variance of the films' performance at their
              premiere and up to 67% of the variance at following weekends; which corresponds to a 23-fold
              increase in prediction accuracy compared to current neurophysiological or traditional methods. We discuss
              our findings in the context of existing literature and hypothesize on the possible connection of the derived
              neurophysiological metrics to cognitive states of focused attention, the encoding of long-term memory, and the
              synchronization of different components of the brain's rewards network. Frontiers
              in Neuroinformatics | www.frontiersin.org 1 December 2017 | Volume 11 | Article 72 Christoforou et al.
              Your Brain on the Movies Beyond the practical implication in predicting and understanding the behavior
              of moviegoers, the proposed approach can facilitate the use of video stimuli in neuroscience research; such
              as the study of individual differences in attention-deficit disorders, and the study of desensitization to media violence.
