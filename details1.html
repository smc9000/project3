          <h1>Perspective Taking vs Mental Rotation:</h1>
            <br><h3>CSP-Based Single-Trial Analysis for Cognitive Process Disambiguation:
             International Conference, BI 2018, Arlington, TX, USA, December 7–9, 2018, Proceedings</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Mental Rotation (i.e. the ability to mentally rotate representations
              of 2D and 3D objects) and egocentric Perspective Taking (i.e. the
              ability to adopt an imagined spatial perspective) represent the two most well-known
              and used types of spatial transformation. Yet, these two spatial transformations
              are conceptually, visually, and mathematically equivalent. Thus, an active debate
              in the field is whether these two types of spatial transformations are cognitively
              and neurally distinct or whether they represent different manifestation of the same
              underlying core mental process. In this study, we utilize a machine learning approach
              to extract neural activity from electroencephalography (EEG) measures and identify neural
              differences between mental rotation and perspective taking tasks. Our results provide novel
              empirical evidence in support of the view that these two types of spatial transformation
              correspond to district cognitive processes at the neural level. Importantly, the proposed
              framework provides a novel approach that can facilitate the study of the neural correlates
              of spatial cognition.

              The transformation of spatial relations is a fundamental skill that is inherentfor many of the
              tasks we carry out in the course of our daily lives. Navigatingin familiar and unfamiliar environments,
              avoiding obstacles during locomotion,providing navigation instructions to others, reasoning about how
              objects andscenes look from perspectives other than the one we occupy physically, all requiretransforming
              mentally a spatial memory we have previously stored about that environment. Spatial transformations are also
              a core component of many apti-tude tests as spatial skills in general are a good predictor for success in
              Science,Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.

                  Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves that illustrates the performance of the classifier on the two datasets for each participant. Light-gray indicate ROC curves whose AUC score did not reach statistically significant level. The diagonal, dashed line shows ROC curve of a random classifer (i.e. guessing).
